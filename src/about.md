This site is created and maintained by Christian Miles. It's based on fantastic [Bookworm stats](https://bookworm-stats.pages.dev/) site by [Joschua](https://twitter.com/selfire1), built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), a static site generator and hosted for free on CloudFlare.

Black and white icons are from [Game Icons](https://game-icons.net/). The main font is Charter. The Evilpedia logo is Rustique by DJR. The scatter plot of ratings are created using vega-lite.

Thanks to Lisa H for most of the initial data and thanks to Chris, Michael and James for all the laughs.
